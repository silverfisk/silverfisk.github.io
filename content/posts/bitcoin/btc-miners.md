description: "Is it profitable to just buy one miner?"

As trust is breaking down between western countries and the Russian Federation, some miners are in incredible pain at the moment. Many who has been hosting their miners in Russia may loose their hardware I expect!

As a result, there may be difficulties finding hosting in the United States as miners scramble to get their hardware to safer places.
*Not your keys, not your bitcoin* as you say, but this concept may have be extended to __*your facility, not your miner*__. There _are_ dangers if you don't host your hardware yourself these days!

I am currently researching miner hosting companies and may come back on the topic.

Small players may have a better investment buying mining stocks as it stands...

## Bitmain Antminer S19XP

The S19XP seem to have outstanding efficency if you can get a hold of one. While Intel is joning the race and may disrupt the mining scene in a couple of hardware iterations, this device seem to be the best bet at the moment.
