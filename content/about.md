I work as a Tech Lead in a newly formed SRE team for a cloud base
backend for autonomous semitrucks.
We have been working mainly with AWS cloud services, but are now focusing on a transition of a Cloud Native observability stack.

In order to always learn new things I try to stay junior and humble.

The decentralization the internet provide is was what got me hooked on the internet since 1995. Similarily Bitcoin and Monero will provide for cash and banking in the 2020s what the Internet did for information at the beginning of the millennium!
