I work as a Tech Lead in a newly formed SRE team for a cloud based backend for autonomous semitrucks.
With a previous focus strongly in favor of AWS cloud services, We now focus on transitioning to a Cloud Native observability stack.

In order to always learn new things I try to stay junior and humble.

The internet provided a fantastic decentralizing oppurtunity in the 1990s. Similarily, Bitcoin and Monero will provide for cash and banking in the 2020s what the Internet did for information at the beginning of the millennium!
