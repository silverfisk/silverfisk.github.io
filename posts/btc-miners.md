# BTC Mining

As trust is breaking down between western countries and the Russian Federation, some miners are in incredible pain at the moment. Many who has been hosting their miners in Russia may loose their hardware!

As a result, there may be difficulties finding hosting in the United States as miners scramble to get their hardware to safer places.
Not your keys, not your bitcoin now may have to include not your mining facility, not your miner. There _are_ dangers if you don't host your hardware yourself.

I am currently researching miner hosting companies and may come back on the topic.
